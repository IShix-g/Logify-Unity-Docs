**💡 Additional Notes**

This plugin has been tested and verified on iOS / Android devices.

* **Platform Compatibility**
  While it should theoretically work in any environment where the `Resources` API is available, operation on platforms other than those listed above is not officially supported.
* **Smart Stripping**
  Heavy debug resources—such as prefabs and UI assets—are automatically stripped from release builds using our proprietary mechanism. This ensures your final application remains lean and professional.
