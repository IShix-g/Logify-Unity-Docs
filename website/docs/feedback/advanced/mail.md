# 📨 Email Integration

Sends feedback using PHP's `mail()` function.
Email sending frequently experiences **"successfully sent but arrives nowhere (or goes to spam)"** depending on server configuration and domain reputation. Carefully test following these steps.

## 📋 Required Environment/Preparation

* **[PHP Server Setup](server-setup.md)** must be completed
* **Server Send Permission**: Your rental server or VPS must allow email sending from PHP (sendmail, etc.)
* **SSL Environment**: Not required but recommended from security and reliability perspectives

## 🛠️ Setup Procedure

### Step 1: Test with Minimal Configuration

First, test by setting only the receiving address (`to`) **without changing** the `from` address automatically generated by `setup.php`.

1. Set `email > enabled` in `config.php` to `true`.
2. Enter your email address in `to`.
3. Leave `from` as the automatically entered domain (e.g., `noreply@example.com`).

### Step 2: Custom Domain Configuration (If Not Receiving)

If Step 1 doesn't work, change the `from` address to an actual (or recommended) format matching the server's domain.

```php
// ...
'email' => [
    'enabled' => true,
    'to'      => 'your-name@gmail.com', // Recipient
    'from'    => 'noreply@example.com', // Match to server domain
],
// ...
```

:::warning From Address Caution
**Do not directly specify Gmail or Yahoo Mail addresses in `from`.**
Sender domain and actual server won't match, causing DMARC/SPF authentication failure and almost certain blocking. Always use "domain hosted by server".

## 🔍 Troubleshooting (If Not Receiving)

If emails don't arrive, consider these factors:

* **Check Spam Folder**:
  Without SPF record configured, high probability of spam classification.
* **Check Server Logs**:
  If PHP-side send error occurs, error details are recorded in `data/debug_???.log`.
* **Gmail Whitelist, etc.**:
  Try setting email reception permission as "safe email" from specific domains.
* **PHP `mail()` Restrictions**:
  Some inexpensive rental servers prohibit `mail()` function usage as spam countermeasure.

## 🧪 Testing {#testing}

Once setup is complete, test whether feedback is actually received.

1. Run app following **[Testing Procedure](https://www.google.com/search?q=../../getting-started/quick-start.md%23testing)**.
2. Open in-game **Custom > Feedback** tab, enter message, and submit.
3. Check the configured `to` mailbox.
