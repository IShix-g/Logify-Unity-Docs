# 🏁 Overview

# Feedback System Overview

Provides a dedicated form to receive feedback directly from testers and development members.
A `Feedback` tab is automatically added within the [Custom](../custom/overview.md) tab, allowing reports to be submitted from there.

## 🎯 Main Features

1. **Automatic Context Information Collection**:
   In addition to user-entered messages, automatically appends OS information, memory status, FPS, stack traces, and more.
2. **Screenshot Attachment**:
   Click the Capture button to include in submission data.
3. **Advanced Security Measures**:
   Optimal protection is applied based on integration mode.
   * **Server Integration**:
     Submission payload is signed with HMAC to prevent tampering in transit and on server side.
   * **Direct Integration (IL2CPP builds only)**:
     Handles confidential information (tokens, etc.) via **C++ Native Plugin (Native Bridge)** dynamically generated by `Secret Generator`. Significantly delays token extraction through memory dumps or static analysis, minimizing security risks.

## 🆔 About Reporter ID

Feedback is assigned a `reporter_id` to identify the sender.

:::info Reporter ID Specification
`reporter_id` is a unique ID generated per device.
**If the app is uninstalled (reinstalled), this ID is regenerated with a new value.**
:::

This allows distinguishing "which device (tester) submitted the report" even in development-stage apps without login functionality.
